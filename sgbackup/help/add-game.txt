                                        from SAVEGAME_ROOT. This is a parsed

    -s --steam <STREAM_APPID>           This variable is optional. It sets the
                                        steam-appid for the game. This should

                                        not set.

    -r --root <SAVEGAME_ROOT>           The root directory of savegames. It is
                                        the directory to which the archiver

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
    Group used is [commandGame]: 
        addGameInteractive  Add a game interactive by default. This is a
                            boolean value (it accepts "true" or "false").
                            If set to "false" you have to call that command
                            with the --interactive flag to enter the
                            interactive mode.

DESCRIPTION
    This command creates .game files, so you don't need to write them by hand.
    The interactive mode asks you for the necessary configuration values for a
    game to be backed up. If you want to write .game files by hand, read
    the documentation shown by "sgbackup help".

    The interactive mode can be enabled or disabled by default (see 
    the section "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES" for more info). If enabled, you can
    add games with the --no-interactive flag from scripts using command line 
    options. If required options are missing, the game is not added and the
    program exits with an error.

    If you have disabled the interactive mode by default, call this command
    with the --interactive flag to enter the interactive mode.
