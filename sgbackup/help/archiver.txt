SYNOPSIS
${SYNOPSIS}

DESCRIPTION
    This command manages archiver settings.

    Without an argument or with "get", the current archiver, being used,
    is displayed.

    When the "list" argument is used, all available archivers are beind
    printed to stdout.

    The scan command scans for installed archivers. Currently this command 
    only works on Windows and only 7zip and WinRAR are looked up. If a
    supported archiver is found, the corresponding .archiver file is created
    and the archiver is made available.

    The "set" argument followed by an ArchiverID is used to set the archiver
    to use for backups.
