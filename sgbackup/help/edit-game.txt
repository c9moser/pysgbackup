DESCRIPTION
    "sgbackup ${COMMAND}" edits the .game file of a game to backup or restore. 
    You need to give a GAME_ID as an argument for the program to know which 
    game to edit. It is an error if the GAME_ID does not exist. If you want
    to add a new game, use "sgbackup add-game" instead.
    
    If in interactive mode is enabled, you are asked for the different
    configuration settings. If you called that command with options, given 
    configuration are displayed as defaults for the game settings.

    When in non interactive mode you have to give the paramters you want to
    change on the commandline.

    The changes made are written to the corresponding .game file and the 
    sgbackup.Game instance is updated accordingly.
