    List games by id and game name. If called wihtout any option, this command
    shows all games. This is the same as calling it with "--active --finished"
    flags.

    Calling "list-active-games" behaves the same as calling this command with
    the "--active" flag. "list-finished-games" is like calling this command
    with the "--finished" flag.
