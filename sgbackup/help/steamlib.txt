${SYNOPSIS}

OPTIONS
    add PATH        Add a Steam library to the list. PATH should be an absolute
                    path to a steam library containing the file "steam.dll". If
                    the path does not exist it is not added to the list.

    list            List registered steam libraries.

    remove PATH     Remove a steam library from the list. PATH should be an
                    absolute path of a already registered steam library. If
                    PATH is not in list this command does nothing.

DESCRIPTION
    Manage Steam libraries. With this command you can add, remove or list
    registered Steam libraries. When calling this command without any
    arguments, it is the same as running "sgbackup ${COMMAND} list".
    
    Steam libraries can be used to scan for Steam games with the 
    "sgbackup steam scan" command by parsing the *.acf files to see which 
    games are in a specific library.
