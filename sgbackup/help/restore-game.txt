DESCRIPTION
    Restore SaveGame backups by GAME_ID. When called without any flags, a
    backup-file can be given as a second argument. If the backup file is not 
    an absolute path, it is looked up in $${BACKUP_DIR}/$${SAVEGAME_NAME}
    directory. If the second argument is missing, it is assumed that you
    want to choose one of the backup files found in the $$BACKUP_DIR
    directory. This is the same as using the "--choose" flag.

    When using the "--latest" flag, the latest backup made, be it an active
    or finished backup, is chosen for restore. To choose the latest active
    or finished backup use the "--latest-active" or "--latest-finished" flag.

    If the $$SAVEGAME_ROOT directory of the game to restore does not exist, 
    the program exits with an error. If the $$SAVEGAME_DIR directory does not
    exist, all missing directories beginning from $$SAVEGAME_ROOT are created.

WARNING
    Your current savegame files might be overwritten without asking for 
    permission by this command, so back them up first!!!
