DESCRIPTION
    This command removes games from the list and deletes the corresponding .game
    file. If backups are enabled, the .game file is backed up and has the format
    "$${GAME}.game.bak". Having backups of .game files is generally a good idea,
    because you can restore .game files by removing the ending ".bak".
