SYNOPSIS
${SYNOPSIS}

DESCRIPTION
    Get/set/list configuration values. If called without any argument, this
    command behaves the same as if it is called with the 'list' subcommand.

    The 'list' subcommand lists all registered configuration options in a
    NAME=VALUE format.

    When called with the 'get' as subcommnd, a configuration key is needed
    as an argument. It is an error if the no configuration key is given. This
    subcommnd prints the variable value to stdout.

    The 'set' subcommand sets a configuration key to a value. It needs a
    valid configuration key as first argument and a value as a second argument.
    It is an error if the configuration key is not reigstered. The value is
    validated if a validate function for that configuration key exists.
