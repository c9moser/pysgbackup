SYNOPSIS
${SYNOPSIS}

DESCRIPTION
    Get/set/delete/list variables. If called without any argument this command
    behaves the same as if called with the 'list' subcommand.

    The 'list' subcommand lists the application variables in a NAME=VALUE 
    format.

    To get a variable value use the 'get' subcommand with a variable name as
    an argument. If the variable does not exist, an empty string is printed
    to stdout.

    The 'set' subcommand sets a variable. This subcommand needs to arguments.
    The first argument is the variable name. The second argument is the
    variable value. It is an error if one argument is missing.

    The 'delete' subcommand deletes a variable. It needs a variable name as
    an argument. If the variable does not exist, this subcommand does nothing.
