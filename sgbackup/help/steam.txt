DESCRIPTION
    Perform action on SteamApps. When called without any argument, this command
    lists registered SteamApps.

    The scan command is always interactive. It asks for actions to perform on
    SteamApps, where you can choos to add, ignore or skip the current App. If
    you choose "ignore", the SteamApp is added to the ignore list. The "add" 
    option is simmilar to the "add-game" command in interactive mode.

    The update command automatically updates the settings of Steam-Games in
    the .game file. This is quite useful if you moved a game from a Steam-
    Library to another.
