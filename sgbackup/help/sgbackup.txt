FILES
    All configuration files of pysgbackup are GLib.KeyFile text files. The 
    file format are GROUPS/SECTIONS with KEY=VALUE pairs. The groups are put
    in square braces ([GROUPNAME]). Sections and keys are case sensitive!

    VALUES are strings. Backslashes (\) are escape characters. To get a
    backslash form a value-string it has to be escaped by another backslash
    (\\). The path "C:\Users\username" has to be written as follows in the
    configfile: "C:\\Users\\username" to be a valid string.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    The configuration of pysgbackup is stored in the configuration file
    "${PYSGBACKUP_CONFIG}".
    This is file a common KeyFile. The default sections of the configuration
    file are documented here. Plugins and user modules may provide their own
    sections and option-keys.

    [sgbackup] SECTION
        archiver            The archiver to use. This value can be set by
                            using the "archiver" command. "sgbackup archiver
                            list" lists the available archivers to use.
        
        backupDirectory     The directory to store the backups in. This should
                            be an absolute path. The directory is created if it
                            does not exist.

        backupVersions      The number of backups to keep. If the value is 0,
                            which is the default, all backups are kept. Set 
                            this value to an positive integer to provide
                            backup versioning.
        
        verbose             Enable verbose messages if set to "true". This
                            option defaults to "false".

    [zipfileArchiver] SECTION
        compression         The compression algorithm to use This option

                            default value for this option is "true".

ARCHIVER FILES
    Archiver files are KeyFiles that store necessary information to run
    commandline archivers in the [archiver] section. It also supports
    variables stored in the [variables] section.

    The [variables] section holds key=value pairs of variables. Do not
    use spaces in variable names!

    Variables given by the program are:
        FILENAME            Filename to use for the archive.

        SAVEGAME_DIR        A relative directory originating from 
                            $$SAVEGAME_ROOT.

        SAVEGAME_ROOT       An absolute path where the archiver should
                            change to when archiving or restoring.

        SGDIR               Same as $$SAVEGAME_DIR.

        SGROOT              Same as $$SAVEGAME_ROOT.

    [archiver] SECTION
        name            Archiver name/id. This mandatory option is used to
                        register the archiver so choose a unique name.

        executable      Archivers executable. This should be a absolute path
                        pointing to the executbale of the archiver.
                        
        backupArgs      The arguments and commandline flags used to archive 
                        savegames. This is a template string and can make use
                        of variables.

        restoreArgs     The arguments and commandline flags used to extract
                        savegame-backups. This option is a template string too.

        verbose         This optional variable should hold the verbose flag for
                        archiving and extracting. It expands to the $$VERBOSE
                        variable in "backupArgs" and "restoreArgs". If verbose
                        output is disabled, the $$VERBOSE variable expands to 
                        an empty string.

GAME FILES
    Game files are KeyFiles. Their filename ends with ".game". They store the
    game settings for backing up savegames. The main group is [game] and are
    located in the "${GAME_DIR}"
    directory.

    Template strings can contain variables. Variables from the evironment,
    global config file variables and local variables can be used.

    [game] SECTION:
        id                      The ID of the game. This should be a short 
                                string without any whitespace chareacters in
                                it. Games are looked up by game ids.

        name                    The name of the game. This should be the name

                                It is a good idea to avoid spaces in this 
                                value, especially when working with scripts
                                on your savegame files.

        savegameRootDirectory   The root directory of the savegame path. It
                                should be an absolute path. This directory 
                                path is stripped from the path in the archive.
                                
                                If this path does not exist, backup will fail.

                                your settings.

        savegameBackupDirectory The directory to back up. This should be a 
                                relative path originating from 
                                "savegameRootDirectory".

                                be used here too.

        installdir              This is an options value. When set it should
                                point to the installation directory of the 
                                game as an absolute path.

        steamAppID              This optional value is the steam app id. It
                                should be a positive integer or "0" if no
                                app id is set.

                                pointing to the documents direcotry in
                                your home folder.
